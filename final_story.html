			<p>“Avengers…. Assemble!”— It’s been almost four years since Captain America delivered the fan favorite line on the big screen. 
				For loyal fans of the <a  href="https://www.marvel.com/movies" target="_blank">Marvel Cinematic Universe </a>(MCU), “Avengers: Endgame” served as the epic conclusion to a ten plus year story known as the Infinity Saga— a 
				carefully crafted and continuous storyline that kept fans coming back for more.
			</p>
			<p>The conclusion was monumental, grossing <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3059975681/" target="_blank"> 1.2 billion </a>world wide in its opening weekend— the most successful opening weekend in film history. 
				But there was more to Endgame’s historic weekend than just setting box office records.</p>
			
			<P>“Avengers: Endgame” received the second highest <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/marvel_cinematic_universe" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> score in franchise history, scoring 94% on the Tomatometer, 
				which was just four percentage points higher than its fan score. </P>
		
			<P>In fact, MCU films that were released prior to “Endgame”—during <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/franchise/marvel-the-infinity-saga" target="_blank">The Infinity Saga</a> — on average had a
				 fan and critic score difference of only five percentage points. This number reflects a franchise that, 
				 according to Rotten Tomatoes approved Critic Nathaniel Rogers, “was exciting for audiences in a communal way.”
				  Fans and critics alike seemed to be enjoying the MCU the same. 
			</P>
		
			<P>Rogers compared The Infinity Saga to an addicting tv series, one that moviegoers couldn’t  “wait to see the next episode of.” 
				But all of this would change after the series finale: “Avengers: Endgame.”  Fans of Marvel viewed each movie knowing that Thanos was coming. 
				But after his defeat, for the first time in nearly 11 years they were left wondering what would come next. 
			</P>
		</section>

			<h3>A New Saga</h3>
			<p>After “Avengers: Endgame” came a new age for the MCU: The Multiverse Saga. With no Thanos-like villain yet in the picture, Marvel took a big hit. 
				Endgame marked one of the last times professional critics and fans would offer similar ratings for the MCU. 
			</p>

			<p>With each new film, the once akin relationship between fan and critic scores for the franchise seems to disappear. 
				Unlike its predecessor, The Multiverse Saga (including all films post Endgame) has an average fan and critic score difference of 
				almost 16 percentage points for each film. While there has been only eight films post “Avengers: Endgame,” that number is a huge outlier 
				compared to the difference of only three percentage points for the first eight movies in The Infinity Saga. 
			</p>

			<P>The Multiverse Saga has seen some of the lowest ratings from critics and the most inconsistency between ratings for each film from both 
				critics and fans, which has many moviegoers worried. </P>

			<h3>Critics V. Fans</h3>
			
			<p>Long term Marvel fan Jack Hynes is concerned for the MCU.“I would see every marvel movie, usually the weekend they come out.”
				 For Hynes, Endgame was his “Natural conclusion,” believing Marvel would retire from the big screen. But to his, and many fan’s surprise, 
				 Marvel returned with more content— including Disney+ exclusive films and shows.
			</p>

			<p>“There’s just too much Marvel content  to keep up with,” said Hynes regarding the 20 plus Marvel films and shows on the streaming platform, 
				with growing concerns of oversaturation. Because of the overwhelming amount of films and shows in the MCU post Endgame, Hynes believes there has been a 
				“huge drop off” in quality within the franchise’s films and shows.  
			</p>

			<p>As a film graduate from Brooklyn college, now working in the industry, Hynes believes Marvel has been rushing to produce more content in The Multiverse Saga. “They’re
				not giving their teams enough time to really focus on the quality. Special effects teams are getting sent 5-6 projects at a time with such a short turnaround,” said Hynes, 
				“no wonder the final product looks unfinished.” 
				</p>
			<p>Compared to Marvel films like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/" target="_blank">“Iron Man,"</a> the difference in quality in the new saga is, as Hynes puts it, “night and day.”

			<h3>A Deep Dive Into the Ratings </h3>
			
			<p>The franchise’s most recent film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954600/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_3_nm_5_q_ant" target="_blank"> "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,”</a>received the lowest critic score yet, 
				scoring a 47% on the Tomatometer. On the other hand, fans rated the film slightly below their average with an 83% approval rating. 
				This is the largest difference in fan and critic scores for any Marvel film, which has many moviegoers scratching their heads. 
			</p>
			<div class="list">
				<h2>Times Critcs and Fan Scores were Equal</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Iron Man 2 (2010)</li>
					<li>Marvel's The First Avengers (2012)</li>
					<li>Guardians of The Galaxy (2014)</li>
		
				</0l>

			<iframe title="Critics and Fans at Odds: Marvel Scores Show Growing Divide" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-izqKs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/izqKs/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 50% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
			</script>
			<br>
			<p>“The disparity between fans and critics is getting worse and worse I must admit,” said amateur film critic Callan Boland of Film 
				Review Club. Despite the worry among some franchise enthusiasts, Boland believes the contrasting methods of reviewing films may be 
				the root cause of the difference in ratings.
			</p>
			<h3>The Tomatoemeter</h3>
			<p>According to Rotten Tomatoes approved Critic Nathaniel Rogers, the <a class="meter" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about#whatisthetomatometer" target="_blank">Tomatometer</a> is used by professional critics to rate movies.
				“The tomatometer operates on a binary system (just like "thumbs up or down" before it),” said Rogers. </p>
			
			<p>For many critics, not just Rogers, it is hard to give a “rotten” or “fresh” Tomato score for films that one would feel “in the middle” about. 
				“Good scores come from consensus,” said Rogers. The Rotten Tomatoes score is a “helpful guide,” according to critics, to give a brief outlook of a film before watching it.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Fan Scores</h3>
			
			<p>For fans, like Boland, rating films takes on a different approach. Factors such as casting, acting, story and cinematography all play a role in how Boland and other 
				fans review films. “There is so much that can influence an exceptional movie, beyond what’s actually in the movie itself,” continued Boland, which is why despite what
				 critics have to say, is why he incorporates his “personal taste” in his reviews
			</p>
			
			<p>“I think personal taste can actually be allowed to influence your score, if you’re open about that in your review,” said bolland. Part of the reason he may give a score a 
				high rating is due to feeling connected with the film. “It has to resonate with me. You'll find that most of my 10/10 movies receive that score because of my personal bias, 
				which I fully recognise and disclose.”</p>
			
			<H3>So, what should we make of this?</H3>
			
			<p>Well, according to Rogers, consensus scores from both fans and critics are brief. “If you're really into movies,” said Rodgers, 
				“find scritics you respond to and put more stock into their opinions than a consensus score.” 
			</p>
			<p>In fact, reviews don't necessarily mean success or failure for films, according to <a href="https://www.stevenlamorte.com" target="_blank"> Film Director Steven LaMorte</a>. For LaMorte, 
				“the real success of a film is not just the money it makes, but the way in which it makes it,” referring to consistency in ticket sales as 
				a measure of success for films. 
			</p>

			<p>“That's where the quality of the film will be the deciding factor in the long term life and success of the movie,” continued LaMorte.</p>

			<h3>What Does This Mean For Marvel?</h3>
			<p>While discrepancy and decline in fan and critic scores doesn't necessarily mean the MCU is “dying” as Jack Hynes would say, it doesn’t mean Marvel is in the clear. 
			</p>

			<p>“Marvel has done brilliantly at connecting an entire universe of movies and shows,” said Boland. “A few sub par films can’t take the credit away from Kevin Feige 
				and what he’s achieved.” 
			</p>

			<p>However, Boland believes Marvel could use a little advice from fans. “We keep saying that the visual effects are terrible recently, they need to act.” Well, 
				Marvel listened. Recently, victoria Alonso, president of VFX for Marvel Studios was fired. Boland, along with other fans, are thankful for Marvel’s responsiveness.</p>

			<p>“After all it’s fans' dedication to this franchise that has made it what it is today and it’s important to listen to us,” concluded Boland.</p>

			<p>Marvel’s next film, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” is set to hit theaters May 5, 2023.
